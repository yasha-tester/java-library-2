# java library


First of all in order for it to work you should add config.properties files with fields "username" and "password" into your src folder.

I want to put methods to DatabaseCRUD:
show books
add book
edit book
delete book

To add books and so on i need inputs.
So i want to use html for this. 

I might need to import mysql-connector one more time for maven, but this far it works as it is.
So now i want to link my form from HTML with a Servlet.

when i submit i get

<code>
File not found
